I have newly added the src directory containing the main and test directories. I realised I have added it in the wrong folder, right after i uploaded them.
Unfortunately, the code is very barebones, the testing didn't work in my favour, I had some connection issues to the database, fixed that only too late, this was a scary experience overall.
Clealy, I suck at coding and missed my shot.
